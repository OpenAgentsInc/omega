# Omega deltas from Zed

Omega is a fork of Zed. Every place Omega deliberately behaves differently from
upstream is recorded here, and every entry is mechanically checked.

The reason this file exists: a fork accumulates silent divergence. Someone
changes a default, a rebase quietly reverts it, and nobody notices until an
owner sees the upstream behaviour again in a release candidate. A comment in
the code is not enough, because a merge can drop the comment and the value
together.

## Rules

- **Every delta has an ID** (`OMEGA-DELTA-NNNN`), and the ID appears in the code
  it governs, so a reader who finds the code finds the reason.
- **Every delta has a programmatic check** in `crates/omega_deltas/`, so a
  rebase that reverts it fails the test suite instead of shipping.
- **Every delta has its own test.** A delta whose check cannot fail is not a
  check. Each test asserts the Omega value *and* names the upstream value it
  replaces, so the diff stays legible.
- **A delta is a policy record, not a changelog.** Record why the owner wanted
  it, not what the commit did.
- **Removing a delta is a policy change**, and needs the same care as adding
  one: delete the entry, the check, and the test together.

Run the checks with:

```sh
cargo test -p omega_deltas
```

## Registry

### OMEGA-DELTA-0001 — No Restricted Mode, no trust prompt

- **Upstream Zed:** `session.trust_all_worktrees` defaults to `false`. Opening
  an unrecognized project shows an "Unrecognized Project" modal offering
  "Stay in Restricted Mode" or "Trust and Continue". Restricted Mode blocks
  project settings, language servers, and MCP server integrations.
- **Omega:** `session.trust_all_worktrees` defaults to `true`. Nothing is
  restricted, so the modal never auto-shows.
- **Why:** owner direction, 2026-07-25, on seeing the prompt in
  `0.2.0-rc3`: *"I HATE THAT. I NEVER WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN. NO RESTRICTED
  SHIT."* Omega is an owner-operated editor opened on the owner's own
  repositories. The prompt interrupts every new project, and declining it
  silently disables language servers and project settings — which reads as the
  editor being broken rather than as a security posture.
- **Also:** the modal body told the user to *"Review .zed/settings.json"*, an
  unclassified Zed identifier on a visible product surface, which omega#16
  forbids independently of the owner's preference.
- **Enforced by:** `crates/omega_deltas/src/omega_deltas.rs`,
  `trust_all_worktrees_defaults_to_true`.
- **Explicit access is retained:** the `ToggleWorktreeSecurity` action still
  opens the modal on demand. This delta removes the *automatic* interruption
  and the restricted default, not the ability to inspect trust.
